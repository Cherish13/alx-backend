## 0x01. Caching

Caching is a technique used in computer science and software engineering to improve the performance and efficiency of data retrieval and processing. It involves storing frequently accessed data or computation results in a temporary storage area called a cache, so that future requests for the same data can be served quickly without repeating the time-consuming original computation or data retrieval.

Caching is particularly useful when there is a significant difference in access times between the cache and the original data source. By keeping a copy of frequently accessed data in a cache, it reduces the need to access the original data source, which may involve costly operations like reading from a disk, making network requests, or performing complex computations.

### Key concepts and features of caching include:

* Cache Hit: When a requested item is found in the cache, it is called a cache hit. The data can be quickly retrieved from the cache, and there is no need to access the original data source.

* Cache Miss: When a requested item is not found in the cache, it is called a cache miss. In this case, the data needs to be fetched from the original data source and then stored in the cache for future use.

* Cache Replacement Policies: When the cache reaches its capacity, it may need to replace some items with new ones. Different cache replacement policies like Least Recently Used (LRU), First-In-First-Out (FIFO), and Random Replacement are used to decide which items to evict from the cache.

* Cache Size and Memory Management: The cache size is an important consideration in caching. If the cache is too small, it may result in frequent cache misses, reducing the caching benefit. If the cache is too large, it may lead to memory management issues.

Caching is widely used in various computing areas, including:

* Web Caching: Web browsers and proxy servers use caching to store frequently accessed web pages, images, and resources. This helps in faster page loading and reduces the load on web servers.

* Database Caching: Database systems use caching to store frequently accessed query results, table data, and indexes. This improves database query performance.

* CPU Caching: Modern CPUs have multiple levels of cache memory to reduce the latency of memory access and speed up computations.

* Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): CDNs use caching to store copies of web content in different geographical locations, enabling faster content delivery to users worldwide.
